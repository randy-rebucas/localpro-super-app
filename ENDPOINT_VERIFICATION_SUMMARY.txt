   NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Implement missing HIGH PRIORITY endpoints (6 endpoints)
   - Provider dashboard metrics & activity (2)
   - Provider reviews management (2)
   - Financial withdrawals list (1)
   - Verify existing implementations (1)

2. Test all IMPLEMENTED endpoints (31 endpoints)
   - Provider profile operations

   - Financial transactions
   - Availability management

3. Implement MEDIUM PRIORITY endpoints (7 endpoints)
