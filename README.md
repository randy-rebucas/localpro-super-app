**Note**: The app includes development mode support for Twilio. If Twilio credentials are not provided, the app will:
- Generate mock verification codes (displayed in console)
- Accept any 6-digit code for verification
- Log SMS messages instead of sending them

### 4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

### 5. Quick Development Setup

If you want to get started quickly without setting up external services:

1. **Create a minimal `.env` file**:
```bash
echo "JWT_SECRET=localpro-dev-secret-key-12345" > .env
echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/localpro-super-app" >> .env
echo "NODE_ENV=development" >> .env
echo "PORT=4000" >> .env
```

2. **Start MongoDB** (if not already running):
```bash
# On Windows (if MongoDB is installed as a service)
net start MongoDB

# On macOS with Homebrew
brew services start mongodb-community

# On Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

3. **Test the API**:
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:4000/health

# Send verification code (will use mock SMS)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/send-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+1234567890"}'

# Verify code (use any 6-digit code like "123456")
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/verify-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+1234567890", "code": "123456", "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"}'

# Test Google Maps geocoding (requires API key)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/maps/geocode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "New York, NY"}'
```
