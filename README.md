## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd localpro-super-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment setup
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your configuration. **For development, you only need to set the JWT_SECRET and MONGODB_URI**:

```env
# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=4000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/localpro-super-app

# JWT (Required)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here

# Twilio Configuration (Optional for development - app will use mock SMS)
# TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
# TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
# TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=your-twilio-verify-service-sid
# TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-twilio-phone-number

# Email Service Configuration (Optional)
# Option 1: Resend (Recommended - Modern API)
# RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
# FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Option 2: SendGrid (API-based)
# SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key

# Option 3: SMTP (SMTP-based)
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_SECURE=false
# SMTP_USER=your-email@yourdomain.com
# SMTP_PASS=your-email-password

# Email Settings
EMAIL_SERVICE=resend

# Google Maps Configuration (Optional)
# GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key
# GOOGLE_MAPS_GEOCODING_API_KEY=your-google-maps-geocoding-api-key
# GOOGLE_MAPS_PLACES_API_KEY=your-google-maps-places-api-key
# GOOGLE_MAPS_DISTANCE_MATRIX_API_KEY=your-google-maps-distance-matrix-api-key
```

**Note**: The app includes development mode support for Twilio. If Twilio credentials are not provided, the app will:
- Generate mock verification codes (displayed in console)
- Accept any 6-digit code for verification
- Log SMS messages instead of sending them

### 4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

### 5. Quick Development Setup

If you want to get started quickly without setting up external services:

1. **Create a minimal `.env` file**:
```bash
echo "JWT_SECRET=localpro-dev-secret-key-12345" > .env
echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/localpro-super-app" >> .env
echo "NODE_ENV=development" >> .env
echo "PORT=4000" >> .env
```

2. **Start MongoDB** (if not already running):
```bash
# On Windows (if MongoDB is installed as a service)
net start MongoDB

# On macOS with Homebrew
brew services start mongodb-community

# On Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

3. **Test the API**:
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:4000/health

# Send verification code (will use mock SMS)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/send-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+1234567890"}'

# Verify code (use any 6-digit code like "123456")
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/verify-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+1234567890", "code": "123456", "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"}'

# Test Google Maps geocoding (requires API key)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/maps/geocode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "New York, NY"}'
```
